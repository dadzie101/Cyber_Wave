 Crime Management System using Vb.Net Forms Application
The world in its present time is technology-driven as it is employed in various sectors 
of the economy to increase performance and to maintain quality assurance in the production
of both goods and services. In the case of the implementation and enforcement of the law in
this technological era, law enforcement agencies are mandated to use improved and integrated
computing systems in the combatting of computer-aided crimes. in this effect the use of cyber-crime management systems 
is employed to keep and maintain a centralized record of crimes and criminals involved in computer/cyberspace crime activities.
Crime is an act that goes against the laws of a society and is a threat to the peace and security of people and this requires effective 
and efficient monitoring to curb this menace. The crime records system employed by security agencies is majorly manual, which is, the use 
of pen and ledgers. This approach of record-keeping renders the records to be exposed to environmental hazards and also uncensored manipulation
from individuals both authorized and unauthorized. This archaic method has resulted in problems with the integrity and authenticity of crime records. 
This project aims at the design and implementation of a cyber-crime management system. In the development of the system, the incremental cycle of the 
waterfall model of the system development life cycle was adopted. The system is implemented using Visual Basic.Net Windows Forms Application for the design
of a high-end interactive user interface and Microsoft Access for a robust database. The cyber-crime management application will enhance the crime-fighting 
abilities of forensic investigators and will result in a lower threat level to the cyber life of citizens, thus, improving national buoyancy.
